# Decimal-to-Binary Converter with Recursion

In this project, I am building a decimal-to-binary converter using JavaScript as part of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum. The focus of this project is to deepen my understanding of recursion, a key programming concept where a function calls itself. Recursion allows us to break down complex problems into simpler sub-problems, solving them step by step until the solution becomes clear.

## Project Goals

- **Learn Recursion:** I’ll explore how recursion works by converting decimal numbers to binary using a recursive approach.
- **Understand the Call Stack:** By using recursion, I’ll delve into how the call stack operates and handles function calls, especially in recursive functions.
- **Visualize Recursion:** I’ll create an animation that visually represents the recursion process, making it easier to see how the function works internally.

## How It Works

In this project, I will write a JavaScript function that converts a decimal number into its binary equivalent. The function will call itself recursively, continuously dividing the decimal number by 2 and storing the remainder until the base case is reached. This approach breaks the problem down into smaller, more manageable pieces.

The project also includes a visual representation of the recursion process, which helps to illustrate how each recursive call contributes to the final result.
