# Todo App with LocalStorage

## Project Overview

As part of the freeCodeCamp curriculum, I'm building a Todo app to learn how `localStorage` works in JavaScript. `localStorage` is a web storage feature that allows me to persist data by storing it as key-value pairs. This project will help me understand how to store, retrieve, and manage data using `localStorage` while building a functional Todo app.

## Features

- Add new tasks to my Todo list.
- Mark tasks as completed or delete them.
- Persist tasks between page reloads using `localStorage`.
- A simple and intuitive user interface with real-time updates.

## Usage

- Add tasks by typing in the input field and pressing Enter.
- Tasks are saved in `localStorage` and will persist even after the page is reloaded.
- I can mark tasks as completed by clicking on them, and delete tasks when they're no longer needed.

## Learnings

Through this project, I am gaining hands-on experience with:

- Using `localStorage` to persist data in the browser
- Manipulating the DOM with JavaScript
- Handling user input and events
- Building a small, functional web app from scratch
