# Learn Basic Debugging by Building a Random Background Color Changer

## Overview

This project demonstrates basic debugging techniques by building a simple random background color changer. Debugging involves identifying and fixing issues within the code. In this lesson, you will assist CamperBot in creating a button that changes the background color of the webpage to a random color each time it is clicked.

## How to Play

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - A button labeled "Change Background Color" is present on the webpage.
   - When the button is clicked, the background color of the page should change to a randomly selected color.

2. **Functionality**:
   - The color change is implemented using JavaScript.
   - A function called `changeBackgroundColor` generates a random color and applies it to the page's background.

3. **Debugging Process**:
   - Identify and fix issues within the JavaScript code that prevent the button from working as expected.
   - Correct the use of the `onclick` property to ensure the function is properly referenced and called upon button click.

4. **Expected Result**:
   - Upon clicking the "Change Background Color" button, the background color of the webpage will change to a randomly generated color.

## Key Learnings

- Understanding the use of `onclick` to handle button clicks in JavaScript.
- Learning to reference functions correctly without immediately invoking them.
- Basic usage of JavaScript for manipulating the DOM and styling elements.

This project serves as a foundational exercise in debugging and provides hands-on experience with identifying and fixing simple issues in JavaScript code.
