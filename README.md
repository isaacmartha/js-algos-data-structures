# My Coding Journey

## Overview

This repository serves as a collection of all the coding lessons and projects I'm working on as part of my learning journey. I am using Visual Studio Code (VSCode) to write, test, and debug my code, and I upload all my progress and completed projects to GitHub for version control and to showcase my work.

## Structure

The repository is organized into folders, each representing a different lesson or project. Inside each folder, you will find the relevant files, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or any other necessary components.

## Future Goals

- Continue learning and expanding my knowledge in web development.
- Work on more complex projects and challenges.
- Explore new technologies and frameworks.

Thank you for checking out my coding journey! Feel free to explore the projects and leave feedback or suggestions.
