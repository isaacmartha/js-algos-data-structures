# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game implemented using JavaScript. The project was created for study purposes through FreeCodeCamp.

## Features

- **Randomized Computer Choices**: The computer's choice is generated randomly using `Math.random()`, ensuring a fair and unpredictable game experience.
- **DOM Manipulation**: The game utilizes DOM manipulation to update the game state and display results dynamically on the webpage.

## How It Works

1. **User Interaction**: Users can choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors via interactive buttons.
2. **Computer Choice**: The computer's move is determined randomly.
3. **Result Display**: The result of the game (win, lose, or draw) is displayed by manipulating the DOM to update the content of HTML elements.

This project was developed as part of my studies on FreeCodeCamp to enhance my skills in JavaScript and web development.

Enjoy the game and see if you can outsmart the computer!
