# Sports Team Cards Project

This project is part of freeCodeCamp's curriculum and focuses on building a web application to process datasets related to sports teams and display the information as interactive cards on the screen. The project emphasizes working with JavaScript concepts and DOM manipulation techniques to create a dynamic and engaging user experience.

## Project Overview

The goal is to create a web app that processes sports team data and outputs it as interactive cards. Through this, I will gain experience in DOM manipulation, object destructuring, event handling, and data filtering.

## Key Concepts Covered

1. **DOM Manipulation**: Dynamically create, update, and delete elements on the webpage using JavaScript.
   
2. **Object Destructuring**: Use object destructuring to extract data efficiently.
   
3. **Event Handling**: Handle user events, such as clicks and input changes, to make the application interactive.

4. **Data Filtering**: Implement data filtering techniques to display relevant information based on user inputs or selections.

5. **Default Parameters**: Utilize default parameters in functions to manage cases where arguments are not provided.

6. **Object.freeze()**: Learn to use `Object.freeze()` to create immutable objects, ensuring data integrity.

7. **Switch Statement**: Reinforce knowledge of switch statements to manage multiple conditions effectively.

8. **map() Method**: Use the `map()` method to create new arrays by transforming elements from an existing array.

## Purpose

This project aims to strengthen understanding of key JavaScript concepts and their practical applications in web development. By completing this project, I'll have a functional sports team card application and a deeper grasp of the JavaScript concepts mentioned above.
